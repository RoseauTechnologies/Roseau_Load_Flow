# OpenDSS

In this directory, there are tutorials related to _OpenDSS_. The two tutorials of this section uses the network of
the [Tutorial on
DER Hosting Capacity - Part 1: Advanced Tools for the Analysis of Three-Phase Unbalanced LV Networks](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-1-AdvancedTools_LV) provided by
[TeamNando](https://github.com/Team-Nando).

## Tutorial 1

This tutorial involves modelling a simple LV network and is designed to familiarize the user with the basic workflow
of _Roseau Load Flow (RLF)_. You will learn the following:

1. How to model common network components such as buses, lines, transformers, etc. in _RLF_ as well as RLF-specific
   components.
2. How to build a network and run power flow simulations in _RLF_.
3. How to access different types of results for various network elements

## Tutorial 2

This series of tutorials focuses on the modelling flexibility of _RLF_ as well as benchmarking _RLF_ with _OpenDSS_, a
popular power flow solver. It will also demonstrate the interoperability of RLF with OpenDSS. In this tutorial, you
will learn the following:

1. How to convert OpenDSS parameters into _RLF_ parameters
2. How to model networks with a single-wire earth return systems in _RLF_
