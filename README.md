## Network data

With this library, there is a sample of 20 low-voltage and 20 medium-voltage feeders included for an easy
start! Each network is given with its summer and winter load point. At _Roseau Technologies_, we are able to provide
the major part of the French medium and low voltage networks. For more information, please contact us at
