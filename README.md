<!-- start rlf-pitch -->

_Roseau Load Flow_ is a powerful load flow solver and static analysis tool that offers:

- **Multi-phase**, **unbalanced** power flow analysis
- A performance optimized solver written in C++
- A catalogue of real-world transformer and line models
- An ergonomic object-oriented Python interface with unit-aware quantities
- A comprehensive documentation with code examples
- Real-world distribution network data samples in the library (with more available on request)

In addition to the following **unique** set of features:

- Support for _floating neutrals_ for loads and sources
- Four-wire multi-phase modelling with no Kron's reduction, no transformations, no assumptions on the
  network topology and no implicit earthing everywhere
- Support for **flexible**, voltage-dependent, loads directly in the Newton algorithm for better
  convergence and stability

This project is compatible with Python version 3.10 and newer. The
[installation instructions](https://roseau-load-flow.roseautechnologies.com/en/latest/Installation.html)
will guide you through the installation process. If you are new to _Roseau Load Flow_, we recommend
you start with the
[getting started tutorial](https://roseau-load-flow.roseautechnologies.com/en/latest/usage/Getting_Started.html).

## Network data

<!-- start rlf-networks -->

_Roseau Load Flow_ ships with a sample of 20 low-voltage and 20 medium-voltage feeder networks. Each
network is provided with its summer and winter load points. At _Roseau Technologies_, we can provide
the major part of the French medium and low voltage networks on demand. For more information, please
contact us at contact@roseautechnologies.com.
