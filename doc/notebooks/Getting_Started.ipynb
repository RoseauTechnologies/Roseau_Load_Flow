    "\n",
    "An electrical network can be built by assembling basic elements provided in\n",
    "[roseau.load_flow.models][api-models]. The following is a summary on the available elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Buses:\n",
    "  * `Bus`: An electrical bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Branches:\n",
    "  * `Line`: A line connects two buses. The parameters of the line are defined by a `LineParameters` object.\n",
    "  * `LineParameters`: This object defines the parameters of a line  (model, impedance, etc.)\n",
    "  * `Switch`: A basic switch element.\n",
    "  * `Transformer`: A generic transformer. The parameters of the transformer are defined by a `TransformerParameters` object.\n",
    "  * `TransformerParameters`: This object defines the parameters of a transformer (model, windings, etc.)\n",
    "* Loads:\n",
    "  The ZIP load model is available via the following classes:\n",
    "  * `ImpedanceLoad`: A constant impedance (Z) load: $S = |V|^2 \\times \\overline{Z}$, $|S|$ is proportional to $|V|^2$.\n",
    "  * `CurrentLoad` A constant impedance (I) load: $S = V \\times \\overline{I}$, $|S|$ is proportional to $|V|^1$.\n",
    "  * `PowerLoad`: A constant power (P) load: $S = \\mathrm{constant}$, $|S|$ is proportional to $|V|^0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A power load can be made flexible (controllable) by using the following class:\n",
    "  * `FlexibleParameter`: This object defines the parameters of the flexible load's control (Maximum power, projection, type, etc.)\n",
    "* Sources:\n",
    "  * `VoltageSource`: A voltage source has a constant voltage and an infinite power source.\n",
    "* Others:\n",
    "  * `Ground`: A ground acts as a perfect conductor. If two elements are connected to the ground, the potentials at the connection points are always equal.\n",
    "  * `PotentialRef`: A potential reference sets the reference of potentials in the network. It can be connected to buses or grounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use some of these elements to build a network with a voltage source, a simple line and a constant power load.\n",
