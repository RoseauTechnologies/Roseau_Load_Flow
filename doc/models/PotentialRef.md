# Potential Reference

As the electrical potentials of the elements of the network are defined as a difference from a reference point, we
need to define this reference point. The potential reference element set the potential of the element it is connected
to $0$.

Usually, the potential reference is attached to the ground to set the potential of the ground to $0$:

Yet, it is completely possible to set the reference of the potentials to a phase of any bus.

```{note}
Only one potential reference per galvanically isolated section of the network can be set.
