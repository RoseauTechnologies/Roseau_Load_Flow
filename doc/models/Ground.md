# Ground

Define a ground component that can be used to connect other elements. It is notably necessary to connect the
shunt admittances of a line.

The equation $I_g = 0$ is always verified.

Note that the potential of the ground does not necessarily equal to $0$. See <project:./PotentialRef.md> for more
information.
