# Changelog

## Version 0.7.0

```{important}
Starting with version 0.7.0, Roseau Load Flow will no longer be supplied as a SaaS. The software will be available as
a standalone Python library.
```

- {gh-pr}`175` {gh-issue}`174` Fix JSON serialization of network with line parameters created from the
  catalogue.
- {gh-pr}`173` Remove the conda installation option.
- {gh-pr}`168` {gh-issue}`166` Fix initial potentials' propagation.
- {gh-pr}`167` {gh-issue}`161` Add a catalogue of lines using the IEC standards. You can use the method
  `LineParameters.get_catalogue()` to get a data frame of the available lines and the method
  `LineParameters.from_catalogue()` to create a line from the catalogue. Several line types, conductor
  material, and insulation types have been updated. Physical constants have been updated to match the
  IEC standards where applicable.
- {gh-pr}`167` The class `LineParameters` now takes optional arguments `line_type`, `conductor_type`,
  `insulator_type` and `section`. These parameters are accessible as properties. They are filled
  automatically when creating a line from the catalogue or from a geometry.
- {gh-pr}`167` Replace all `print_catalogue()` methods by `get_catalogue()` methods that return a
  data frame instead of printing the catalogue to the console.
- {gh-pr}`167` Enumeration classes no longer have a `from_string` method, you can call the enumeration
  class directly with the string value to get the corresponding enumeration member. Case-insensitive
  behavior is preserved.
- {gh-pr}`167` {gh-issue}`122` Add checks on line height and diameter in the `LineParameters.from_geometry()`
  alternative constructor. This method will try to guess a default conductor and insulation type if
  none is provided.
- {gh-pr}`163` **BREAKING CHANGE:** roseau-load-flow is no longer a SaaS project. Starting with version
  0.7.0, the software is distributed as a standalone Python package. You need a license to use it for
  commercial purposes. See the documentation for more details. This comes with a huge performance
  improvement but requires a breaking change to the API:
  - The `ElectricalNetwork.solve_load_flow()` method no longer takes an `auth` argument.
  - To activate the license, you need to call `roseau.load_flow.activate_license("MY LICENSE KEY")`
    or set the environment variable `ROSEAU_LOAD_FLOW_LICENSE_KEY` (preferred) before calling
    `ElectricalNetwork.solve_load_flow()`. More information in the documentation.
  - Several methods on the `FlexibleParameter` class that previously required `auth` are changed. Make
    sure to follow the documentation to update your code.
- {gh-pr}`163` {gh-issue}`158` Fix `ElectricalNetwork.res_transformers` returning an empty dataframe
  when max_power is not set.
- {gh-pr}`163` Several unused exception codes were removed. An `EMPTY_NETWORK` code was added to indicate
  that a network is being created with no elements.
- {gh-pr}`163` Remove the `ElectricalNetwork.res_info` attribute. `ElectricalNetwork.solve_load_flow()` now
  returns the tuple (number of iterations, residual).
- {gh-pr}`163` Remove the `Bus.clear_short_circuits()` and `ElectricalNetwork.clear_short_circuits()`
  methods. It is currently not possible to clear short-circuits from the network.
- {gh-pr}`163` Improve performance of network creation and results access.
- {gh-pr}`163` Attributes `phases` and `bus` are now read-only on all elements.
- {gh-pr}`151` Require Python 3.10 or newer.

## Version 0.6.0

- {gh-pr}`149` {gh-issue}`145` Add custom pint wrapper for better handling of pint arrays.
- {gh-pr}`148` {gh-issue}`122` deprecate `LineParameters.from_name_lv()` in favor of the more generic
  `LineParameters.from_geometry()`. The method will be removed in a future release.
- {gh-pr}`142` {gh-issue}`136` Add `Bus.res_voltage_unbalance()` method to get the Voltage Unbalance
  Factor (VUF) as defined by the IEC standard IEC 61000-3-14.
- {gh-pr}`141` {gh-issue}`137` Add `ElectricalNetwork.to_graph()` to get a `networkx.Graph` object
  representing the electrical network for graph theory studies. Install with the `"graph"` extra to
  get _networkx_.
  `ElectricalNetwork` also gained a new `buses_clusters` property that returns a list of sets of
  IDs of buses that are connected by a line or a switch. This can be useful to isolate parts of the
  network for localized analysis. For example, to study a LV subnetwork of a MV feeder. Alternatively,
  to get the cluster certain bus belongs to, you can use `Bus.get_connected_buses()`.
- {gh-pr}`141` Add official support for Python 3.12. This is the last release to support Python 3.9.
- {gh-pr}`138` Add network constraints for analysis of the results.
  - Buses can define minimum and maximum voltages. Use `bus.res_violated` to see if the bus has
    over- or under-voltage.
  - Lines can define a maximum current. Use `line.res_violated` to see if the loading of any of the
    line's cables is too high.
  - Transformers can define a maximum power. Use `transformer.res_violated` to see if the transformer
    loading is too high.
  - The new fields also appear in the data frames of the network.
- {gh-pr}`133` {gh-issue}`126` Add Qmin and Qmax limits of flexible parameters.
- {gh-pr}`132` {gh-issue}`101` Document extra utilities including converters and constants.
- {gh-pr}`131` {gh-issue}`127` Improve the documentation of the flexible loads.
  - Add the method `compute_powers` method to the `FlexibleParameter` class to compute the resulting flexible powers
    for a given theoretical power and a list of voltage norms.
  - Add the `plot_control_p`, `plot_control_q` and `plot_pq` methods to the `FlexibleParameter` class to plot the
    control curves and control trajectories.
  - Add the extra `plot` to install `matplotlib` alongside `roseau-load-flow`.
- {gh-pr}`131` Correction of a bug in the error message of the powers setter method.
- {gh-pr}`130` Mark some internal attributes as private, they were previously marked as public.
- {gh-pr}`128` Add the properties `z_line`, `y_shunt` and `with_shunt` to the `Line` class.
- {gh-pr}`125` Speed-up build of conda workflow using mamba.

  - Add documentation for the `LineParameters` alternative constructors.

## Version 0.3.0

- Every network elements have an `id` which must be unique among the same type of elements.
- The argument `n` (number of ports) have been replaced by a `phase(s)` argument which can be for
  instance `an`, `abc`, `abcn`, `ca`, etc.
- The classes `SimplifiedLine` and `ShuntLine` have been merged into a single class `Line` whose
  behaviour depends on the provided `LineParameters`.
- The classes `DeltaDeltaTransformer`, `DeltaWyeTransformer`, `DeltaZigzagTransformer`,
  `WyeDeltaTransformer`, `WyeWyeTransformer` and `WyeZigzagTransformer` have been replaced by an
  unique `Transformer` class whose behaviour depends on the provided `TransformerParameter`.
- The classes `LineCharacteristics` and `TransformerCharacteristics` have been renamed into
  `LineParameters` and `TransformerParameters`.
- The classes `AdmittanceLoad` and `DeltaAdmittanceLoad` have been removed. Please use
  `ImpedanceLoad` instead, with the desired `phases` argument.
- The classes `DeltaImpedanceLoad` and `DeltaPowerLoad` have been removed. Please use the classes
  `ImpedanceLoad` and `PowerLoad` instead with `phases="abc"`.
- The class `FlexibleLoad` have been removed. Please use the new `flexible_params` argument of the
  `PowerLoad` class constructor.
- The `VoltageSource` is not anymore a subclass of the class `Bus`. It can now be connected to a bus
  just like a load.
- All elements are aware of the network they belong to. It helps the user to avoid mistakes
  (connecting elements from different networks). It also allows showing user warnings when accessing
  to outdated results.
- All properties retrieving results are now prefixed by `res_`.
- Additional results per elements: `res_potentials`, `res_voltages`, `res_series_losses`,
  `res_lie_losses`, etc.
- Pandas Data frame results: now, every result can be retrieved in Pandas Data frame from the
  `ElectricalNetwork` instance. These methods are also prefixed by `res_`.
- Every physical input can be given as quantities (magnitude and unit) using the `Q_` class.
- Every result (except Pandas data frame) are quantities (magnitude and unit).
- Elements can all be serialized as JSON.
- Results of an `ElectricalNetwork` can be serialized as JSON and read from a JSON file.
- The documentation has been improved.
