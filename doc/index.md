# Roseau Load Flow

`Roseau Load Flow` is a load flow solver capable of modeling 3-phase unbalanced power systems with
a wide variety of models for lines, transformers, loads, and sources. This software is developed
by [Roseau Technologies](https://www.roseautechnologies.com/en).

With this library, there is a sample of 20 low-voltage and 20 medium-voltage feeders included for an easy
start! Each network is given with its summer and winter load point. At _Roseau Technologies_, we are able to provide
the major part of the French medium and low voltage networks. For more information, please contact us at
