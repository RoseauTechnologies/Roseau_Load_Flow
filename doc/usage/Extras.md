# Extra features

`roseau-load-flow` comes with some extra features that can be useful for some users.

## Graph theory

{meth}`ElectricalNetwork.to_graph() <roseau.load_flow.ElectricalNetwork.to_graph>` can be used to
get a {class}`networkx.Graph` object from the electrical network.

The graph contains the geometries of the buses in the nodes data and the geometries and branch
types in the edges data.

```{note}
This method requires *networkx* which is not installed by default in pip managed installs. You can
install it with the `"graph"` extra if you are using pip: `pip install "roseau-load-flow[graph]"`.
```

In addition, you can use the property
{meth}`ElectricalNetwork.buses_clusters <roseau.load_flow.ElectricalNetwork.buses_clusters>` to
get a list of sets of IDs of buses in galvanically isolated sections of the network. In other terms,
to get groups of buses connected by one or more lines or a switches, stopping at transformers. For
example, for a network with a MV feeder, this property returns a list containing a set of MV buses
IDs and all sets of LV subnetworks buses IDs. If you want to get the cluster of only one bus, you
can use {meth}`Bus.get_connected_buses <roseau.load_flow.models.Bus.get_connected_buses>`

If we take the example network from the [Getting Started page](./Getting_Started.md#creating-a-network):

```pycon
>>> set(source_bus.get_connected_buses())
{'sb', 'lb'}
>>> set(load_bus.get_connected_buses())
{'sb', 'lb'}
>>> en.buses_clusters
[{'sb', 'lb'}]
```

As there are no transformers between the two buses, they all belong to the same cluster.

## Symmetrical components

{mod}`roseau.load_flow.sym` contains helpers to work with symmetrical components. For example, to
convert a phasor voltage to symmetrical components:

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import roseau.load_flow as rlf
>>> v = 230 * np.exp([0, -2j * np.pi / 3, 2j * np.pi / 3])
>>> v
array([ 230.  +0.j        , -115.-199.18584287j, -115.+199.18584287j])
>>> v_sym = rlf.sym.phasor_to_sym(v)
>>> v_sym
array([[ 8.52651283e-14-1.42108547e-14j],
       [ 2.30000000e+02+4.19109192e-14j],
       [-7.10542736e-14-2.84217094e-14j]])
```

As you can see, for this positive-sequence balanced voltage, only the positive-sequence component
is non-zero. Converting back to phasor, you get the original voltage values back:

```pycon
>>> sym_to_phasor(v_sym)
array([[ 230.-7.21644966e-16j],
       [-115.-1.99185843e+02j],
       [-115.+1.99185843e+02j]])
```

You can also convert pandas Series to symmetrical components. If we take the example network of the
[Getting Started](Getting_Started.md) page:

```pycon
>>> rlf.sym.series_phasor_to_sym(en.res_buses_voltages["voltage"])
bus_id  sequence
lb      zero        8.526513e-14-1.421085e-14j
        pos         2.219282e+02+4.167975e-14j
        neg        -5.684342e-14-2.842171e-14j
sb      zero        9.947598e-14-1.421085e-14j
        pos         2.309401e+02+3.483159e-14j
        neg        -4.263256e-14-2.842171e-14j
Name: voltage, dtype: complex128
```

The `rlf.sym` module also provides useful helpers to create three-phase balanced quantities by only
providing the magnitude of the quantities. For example, to create a three-phase balanced positive
sequence voltage:

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import roseau.load_flow as rlf
>>> V = 230 * rlf.sym.PositiveSequence
>>> V
array([ 230.  +0.j        , -115.-199.18584287j, -115.+199.18584287j])
>>> np.abs(V)
array([230., 230., 230.])
>>> np.angle(V, deg=True)
array([   0., -120.,  120.])
```

Similarly, you can use `rlf.sym.NegativeSequence` and `rlf.sym.ZeroSequence` to create negative-sequence
and zero-sequence quantities respectively. Because these are so common, you can also access them
directly from the top-level module as `rlf.PositiveSequence`, etc.

## Potentials to voltages conversion

{mod}`roseau.load_flow.converters` contains helpers to convert a vector of potentials to a vector of
voltages. Example:

```pycon
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import roseau.load_flow as rlf
>>> potentials = 230 * np.array([1, np.exp(-2j * np.pi / 3), np.exp(2j * np.pi / 3), 0])
>>> potentials
array([ 230.  +0.j        , -115.-199.18584287j, -115.+199.18584287j,
          0.  +0.j        ])
>>> phases = "abcn"
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltages(potentials, phases)
array([ 230.  +0.j        , -115.-199.18584287j, -115.+199.18584287j]) <Unit('volt')>
```

Because the phases include the neutral, the voltages calculated are phase-to-neutral voltages.
You can also calculate phase-to-phase voltages by omitting the neutral:

```pycon
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltages(potentials[:-1], phases[:-1])
array([ 345.+199.18584287j,    0.-398.37168574j, -345.+199.18584287j]) <Unit('volt')>
```

To get the phases of the voltage, you can use `calculate_voltage_phases`:

```pycon
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltage_phases(phases)
['an', 'bn', 'cn']
```

Of course these functions work with arbitrary phases:

```pycon
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltages(potentials[:2], phases[:2])
array([345.+199.18584287j]) <Unit('volt')>
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltage_phases(phases[:2])
['ab']
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltage_phases("abc")
['ab', 'bc', 'ca']
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltage_phases("bc")
['bc']
>>> rlf.converters.calculate_voltage_phases("bcn")
['bn', 'cn']
```

## Constants

{mod}`roseau.load_flow.constants` contains some common mathematical and physical constants like the
resistivity and permeability of common materials in addition to other useful constants. Please refer
to the module documentation for more details. An enumeration of available materials can be found in
the {mod}`roseau.load_flow.types` module.

Some commonly used constants can be accessed directly from the top-level module for convenience.
Notable top-level constants:

- `rlf.SQRT3`: the square root of 3. Useful for converting between phase-to-phase and phase-to-neutral
  voltages.
- `rlf.ALPHA`: the alpha constant. Rotates a complex number by 120°.
- `rlf.ALPHA2`: the alpha constant squared. Rotates a complex number by 240° (or -120°).

## Voltage unbalance

It is possible to calculate the voltage unbalance due to asymmetric operation. There are many
definitions of voltage unbalance (see {cite:p}`Girigoudar_2019`). In `roseau-load-flow`, you can
use the {meth}`~roseau.load_flow.models.Bus.res_voltage_unbalance` method on a 3-phase bus to get
the Voltage Unbalance Factor (VUF) as per the IEC definition:

```{math}
VUF = \frac{|V_{\mathrm{n}}|}{|V_{\mathrm{p}}|} \times 100 (\%)
```

Where $V_{\mathrm{n}}$ is the negative-sequence voltage and $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the positive-sequence voltage.

```{note}
Other definitions of voltage unbalance could be added in the future. If you need a specific
definition, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
