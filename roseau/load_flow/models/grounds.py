       To connect a ground to a bus on a given phase, use the :meth:`Ground.connect` method.
       This method lets you specify the bus to connect to as well as the phase of the connection.
       If the bus has a neutral and the phase is not specified, the ground will be connected to the
       neutral, otherwise, an error will be raised because the phase is needed.

    2. Connecting to a line with shunt components:

       To connect a ground to a line with shunt components, pass the ground object to the
       :class:`Line` constructor. Note that the ground connection is mandatory for shunt lines.
