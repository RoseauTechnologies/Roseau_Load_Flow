# Versioned network JSON files for testing

## JSON files

**DO NOT MODIFY** the JSON files in this directory if the tests fail. Adapt the converter functions in the
`roseau.load_flow.io.dict` module instead.

## Generator scripts

Scripts in the _generators_ directory are used to generate the versioned network JSON files. They are executed using old
versions of rlf.

**DO NOT UPGRADE** these scripts when modifying rlf.
